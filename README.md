3. **Baggage Info Bot**<br>

4. **Flight Team Creation Bot**<br>

5. **Fleet Bot**<br>
    This bot allows you to search for aircrafts at given base location from the fleet owned by the airlines. You can also assign aircraft to particular flight or mark it as grounded for maintenance.<br>

## Cross Verticals 

These are applications that have cross industry relevance.  

**Notification Bot**<br>
Notification bot will let the admin notify specific members on Teams. This app lets the admin send out sample notifications on weather changes relevant to an airlines firm, operations delays in a manufacturing set up and also notifications on social events

**Employee survey / Polling bot**<br>
The bot lets the admin create and publish a survey to specific members within an organization. It als enables sending out selective reminders to the users who have not yet completed the survey. The survey results are also available for download in the form of a .csv file that can then be used for reporting purposes. 

## Manufacturing

**Inventory Bot**<br>
The inventory bot helps get a view of the available inventory across multiple products and locations. It also lets the users view, block and also request new inventory as the need may be. 

## Professional Services 

**Employee Leave**<br>
The app has an employee and manager workflow with bot and tab capabilities. It enables an employee to make a new vacation request, check leave balance status and public holidays. In addition, when an employee makes a new vacation request, the manager gets a notification and the approval / reject workflow can be completed from within the app on Teams.  

## Try it yourself

All these samples are deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading respective app packages (.zip files linke below) to one of your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant; see [step 6 here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-tenant#turn-on-microsoft-teams-for-your-organization).) These apps are running on the free Azure tier, so it may take a while to load if you haven't used it recently and it goes back to sleep quickly if it's not being used, but once it's loaded it's pretty snappy.
